<em>Here you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions about </em>CORE<em>. Should your question not be answered below or should you wish to provide general feedback, please feel free to <a href="mailto:core@hcommons.org?subject=CORE" target="_blank">e-mail us</a>. We will respond as quickly as possible, and certainly within one working day.</em>

<strong>Why should I deposit my work with <em>CORE?</em></strong>
Depositing your work with a repository ensures that it is archived and attributed to you and makes it quickly and widely available to others.

Works deposited with <em>CORE</em> are automatically given a permanent identifier called a DOI. DOIs provide persistent, citable metadata for scholarly and creative works, including gray literature such as blog posts, syllabi, data sets, presentations, and video and audio files.

Since you can associate items you deposit with a special interest group on <em>Humanities Commons</em>, <em>CORE</em> offers the added advantage of sharing your work with an immediate audience of scholars in your field.

<strong>What kinds of items can I deposit with <em>CORE</em>?</strong>
The following item types can be deposited with <em>CORE</em>: abstract, article, bibliography, book, book chapter, catalog, chart, code or software, conference publication, course material or learning objects, data set, documentary, dissertation, essay, fictional work, finding aid, image, interview, map, music, performance, photograph, presentation, report, review, syllabus, technical report, thesis, translation, visual art.

<strong>What file types does <em>CORE</em> accept?</strong>
CORE accepts the following file types. Please note that if you are uploading a word processed document, PDF files are preferred for reasons of cross-platform compatibility and security.

<strong>How do I cite an item I find in <em>CORE</em>?</strong>
To cite an item not covered by the usual style guides, we recommend that you include the following information: author name(s), title, date of creation, version or edition (if any), permanent URL, DOI.

<strong>How do I make my work available for others to use?</strong>
Works deposited to <em>CORE</em> are covered by the <a href="/terms/"><em>Humanities Commons</em> Terms of Service</a>, which stipulate that users “may not copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, sell or transfer, create derivative works from, or in any other way exploit any of the Site Content (including any programs, code, and software contained therein) in any manner, whether in whole or in part, unless authorized by us in writing in advance, except that if a user has made the content he or she posts to the Site available under the terms of a Creative Commons license, [they] may use that content in accordance with that license.”

If you are depositing an image, data set, or other item that you would like to make available to other scholars, we encourage you to grant such permission by way of a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons license</a>. You have the option to attribute such a license to your work at the time of deposit.

<strong>How do I know if I can legally deposit an article I’ve published elsewhere?</strong>
Policies vary by publisher and journal. Look up the journal or publisher name in the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php">SHERPA-RoMEO database</a> to find out its policies covering archiving and deposit. For example, if your article was published in <em>PMLA</em>, you may deposit preprint versions of the article (ones that have not yet been peer reviewed) as well as postprint (peer-reviewed) articles. You may also publish the PDF available from the publisher as long as you comply with certain conditions. If your article is published in <em>French Studies</em>, you may archive a preprint version before it is accepted and a postprint version after a two-year embargo but not the publisher’s PDF.

If you wish to deposit a book chapter or a monograph, please check your agreement with the publisher.

<strong>How can I find items that have been shared with a Humanities Commons special interest group?</strong>
Go the forum’s page on the <em>Commons</em> and click on Deposits in the left-hand menu.

<strong>How do I share my deposit with multiple <em>Humanities Commons</em> groups? </strong>
If you are using a Mac, left click the first forum with which you want to associate your deposit, then hold down the COMMAND key and click on the other forums. If you are using a PC, click the first forum, hold down the CTRL key, and click each of the other forums with which you want to share your deposit.
