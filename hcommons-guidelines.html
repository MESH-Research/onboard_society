Members are welcome to post links on <em>Humanities Commons</em> to job announcements that are likely to be of interest to other members. In posting such links, please keep in mind that United States Department of Labor <a href="http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/faqsanswers.cfm#cutrec6">regulations</a> require academic employment opportunities to be advertised in a national professional journal such as the <a href="http://www.mla.org/jil"><em>MLA Job Information List</em></a>. Posts on <em>Humanities Commons</em> should supplement and link to these primary recruitment announcements.

The <em>Humanities Commons</em> messaging system is intended for scholarly exchange related to the study of languages and literatures. To protect members’ privacy, <em>Humanities Commons</em> does not allow use of the messaging system for commercial purposes or for mass mailings of any kind. The MLA may at its sole discretion suspend or remove the account privileges of any member. These Guidelines for Participation, together with the <em>Humanities Commons</em> <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a> and <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>, constitute the agreement between you and the MLA governing your use of the Network.

The MLA will work to ensure that <em>Humanities Commons</em> remains a valuable resource for our members, and we greatly appreciate contributions from participants like you, who make the effort worthwhile. Thank you.
