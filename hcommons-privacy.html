Information about your membership in any official Society groups will be used to automatically place you into the associated groups on <em>Humanities Commons</em>. Except as provided in this Privacy Statement, the rest of the information taken from your Society membership record is used only for our authentication, debugging, and other internal purposes and will not be shared with any third parties.

Uses of Your Information in Your Profile; Sharing User Information with Third Parties</h1><p><em>Humanities Commons</em> is a professional scholarly network designed to promote collaboration and discussion among scholars, students, and practitioners in humanities fields, as well as dissemination of members’ work to the broader intellectual community online, and as such, it counts openness among its primary values. The purpose of the MLA and the Participating Societies in collecting User Information is to operate <em>Humanities Commons</em> and allow our members to connect and interact with one another. As a result, much of your activity and communication that takes place within <em>Humanities Commons</em> is openly visible to any visitor to <em>Humanities Commons</em>, whether or not the visitor is a <em>Commons</em>member or is logged in, and is likewise visible to search engines. This section describes how certain User Information will be made available on <em>Humanities Commons</em>.</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><strong>Profile and Activity Information</strong>. All of the User Information you supply for your Profile (such as your publications, educational background, etc.) will be viewable by any visitor to <em>Humanities Commons</em>, whether or not the visitor is a Network member or is logged in. If you do not wish to share this User Information, do not add it to your Profile. Similarly, except as specifically described below, all of your activity on <em>Humanities Commons</em> will be viewable by any visitor to <em>Humanities</em> <em>Commons</em>, including through your Profile, whether or not the visitor is a Network member or is logged in.</li><li><strong>Private Activities</strong>. Limited portions of your activities on <em>Humanities Commons</em> are private—for example, restricted only to members of a Society committee. Your activity in these sections will not appear in your Profile, and only certain other <em>Humanities Commons</em> users as described below will be able to see this activity.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li><strong>Private and Hidden Groups</strong>. <em>Humanities Commons</em> allows <em>Commons</em> members to create private and hidden groups, in addition to public groups. The existence of private groups is visible to all Networks visitors, and membership in those groups is visible in their members’ profiles, but only <em>Commons</em> members who have been permitted to join a private group by the administrator of the group will be able to see other <em>Commons</em> members’ activity in the group. Hidden groups are similar, except that only <em>Commons</em> members who have been invited to join the group can see that the hidden group exists, and membership in hidden groups is not included in their members’ profiles.</li><li><strong>Restricted Sites</strong>. <em>Humanities Commons</em> allows <em>Commons</em> members to restrict access to sites they have created and will administer; only those <em>Commons</em> members identified by the site administrator will be able to see the content posted on the sites, though the administration of the site will be visible in the administrator’s profile.</li><li><strong>Private Messages</strong>. The Network allows <em>Commons</em> members to send private messages to other <em>Commons</em> members; these messages and the fact that <em>Commons</em> members have sent or received them will not be viewable by anyone except the sender and the recipient.</li></ol></li></ol><p>If you are the administrator of a group or site on <em>Humanities Commons</em>, you may adjust settings to restrict the availability of those areas of the Network to other <em>Commons</em> members, or to members of a Participating Society. Please see our <a href="http://faq.mla.hcommons-dev.org/">FAQ</a> for more information.</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="3"><li><strong>Network Communications</strong>. We may use your User Information to send you important messages about the Network through e-mail or through other means available through <em>Humanities Commons</em>. For example, we may send you important messages about the operation of <em>Humanities Commons</em> (e.g., if we add or change Network functionality or change our Terms of Service or this Privacy Statement).</li><li><strong>Nonpersonal Data</strong>. We may use Nonpersonal Data to help diagnose and repair issues with your use of the Network, administer the Network, monitor Network usage, provide customization options, understand how our visitors use <em>Humanities Commons</em>, make decisions about how to change and adapt the Network, and create anonymous Network statistics. From time to time, we may release Nonpersonal Data in aggregate form (for instance, by publishing trends in Network usage). We will not release individual information, only aggregate information.</li><li><strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong>. The MLA and the Participating Societies take the privacy of our users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your User Information to third parties, except as described in this Privacy Statement, unless disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders, or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the MLA or the Participating Societies, our users, or the public.</li></ol><p>The MLA uses third-party service providers (“Service Providers”) to provide certain services, such as hosting, which are necessary for the MLA’s operations, including the operation of the Network. We also use Service Providers to enhance member experience of the <em>Commons</em>, by, for example, providing integrations with services for discovering and disseminating scholarly work. We will take reasonable measures to ensure that these Service Providers will access and use User Information only for the purpose of providing services to the MLA or on our behalf.

However, you cannot change how your non-private activity on <em>Humanities Commons</em> is shared, except by closing your account.</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><strong>Accessing and Changing Your Profile Information</strong>. You can review the information you provided for your Profile and make changes to that information at any time by clicking on the Edit My Profile link on your Profile or in the navigation bar drop-down menu below your name in the top right corner of every page of the Network.  After your change is processed, the MLA may retain residual copies of the old information in its backup and archival copies of its database for a limited period of time.</li><li><strong>Closing Your Account</strong>.
